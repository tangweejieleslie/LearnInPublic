Regex: Search pattern to find something in a given string

- sequence of character; known as "literal character"; i.e. literally what you explictly define



- "meta" character: indication of some generalized pattern; i.e. think pattern in wild card

- reminds me of Access database "template" for data input


How do we think in terms of REGEX?


- first thought: useful for parsing heavy application: e.g. apps that convert CSV to JSON or something?

1. consider the pattern that we are trying to extract


--------------

a single string that serve as example for all the different regex pattern

- to reduce switch and processing resource (i.e. make it easier for the reader)
