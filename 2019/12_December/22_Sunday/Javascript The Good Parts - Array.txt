Arrays

arrays literal
- first value get property name '0', second gets '1' etc....


var empty = [];
var numbers = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three'];

empty[1] // returns undefined
numbers[1] // returns 'one'

- numbers inherits from Array.prototype
- have 'length' property
- have access to some useful methods
- JS arrays can have a mixture of values

Length Property
- not upper bound
- no array bounds error; e.g. number[10] will just return undefined instead of error
- we can explictly assign length value; it will remove all values after that assign length. but will not allocated more space if set larger than current length
- use push to add new value to end of array
- alternatively use array[array.length] to assign new value to the end

Delete
- remove element from array, that position becomes undefined, the rest of the elements stays in place
- splice method; splice(position, number of items)
- will cause every property after the deleted property to be removed and reinserted with a new key
- operation will take some time for large arrays


Enumeration
- JS arrays are really objects
- for in can be used to iterate all properties in array
- but won't be produced in numerical order
- be wary of unexpected properties from the prototype chain
- simpler method is just use for loop

Confusion
- common error: use object when array is required, vice versa
- rule of thumb: if property names are small sequential integers, use array. else, use objects

- typeof alone does not differentiate array from objects
- define our own is_array function

var is_array = function (value) {

}

Methods
- set of methods for acting on array; stored in Array.prototype
- we can extend the Array.prototype by adding new methods that can be used by all arrays
- we can also extend individual array objects; i.e. adding new methods for specific arrays 



Dimensions
- JS arrays are usually not initialized; i.e. a new array created with [] would be empty
- if we want to create an array with values initialized to 0; we need to define our own method
- we can create arrays of arrays to make 2-d array
- this can be done by a simple for loop
