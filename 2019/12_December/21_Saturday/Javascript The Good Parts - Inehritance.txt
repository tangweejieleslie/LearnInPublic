- Inheritance, makes it easy to reuse code
- in JS; objects inherits directly from other objects
- in classical language; objects inherit from another CLASS; objects are instances of classes


Inheritance Patterns

- basically different ways to implement inheritance in JS

Method 1
Pseudo-Classical
- this mimics classical approaches to implement inheritance; but to me, the implementation feels confusing and possible prone to error

- the idea is straightforward though

Method 2
Object Specifiers

this part is about how we write the constructors

instead of something like 
var myObject = maker(f,l,m,c,s);

we pass in an object which contains the required parameters as follow

var myObject = maker({
first: f,
last: l,
middle: m,
state: s,
city: c
});

The first method requires each invocation of the constructor to pass in the parameters in a specific order; which could be a cumbersome process. i.e. imagine having to refer to the function each time you invoke the constructor. 

The second method is more flexible and less error prone. i.e. explictly declare the parameters through the properties in the object.

Method 3
Prototypal

Idea: new object can inherit properties of an old object

Step 1: create a base object
Step 2: 



Method 4: Functional

Objective: implement privacy; i.e. private methods and variables

Method 5: Parts

- compose objects out of a set of parts
