- psychopathology of everyday things

frustration caused by everyday objects
- because we can't figure out how to use
- plastic that's impossible to open
- in short, frustration occurs when the user can't figure out what to do. abstracting this into general model: when the user has an intention, but the action taken leads to an unexpected result.

Intention -> Action -> Expectation

---------

Human mind tailored to make sense of the world; i.e. the key is to give the mind a slight clue

Well designed objects are 
- easy to interpret and understand

Contrast: poor designed objects
- difficult to use
- frustrating
- no clues
- false clues
- which ended up traping the user and thwarting the "normal" process of interpretation and design

Frustration of everyday life
- pushing doors that's meant to be pulled
- getting trapped in between doors

Key Principles
- good design naturally provide answers

This is done by

1. Visibility: of clues; so as to signal natural indication of action

example: if the door is fitted with a handle, often you would expect to pull it. if it's fitted with a plate, you would tend to push it.


2. Mapping
- between what user want to do, and what appears to be possible 


3. Provide visual feedback to each action: no feedback would lead to user thinking that the thing is not working


4. Make key function obvious, visible. just the right things to be visible
